## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

#### Project Overview

The project aims to combine happiness and quality of life data with mental health statistics to create a comprehensive perspective on global well-being. By merging these datasets, we aim to identify and understand the fundamental dynamics influencing well-being globally and investigate the connections among important determinants. Through visualizations, we aim to highlight trends, disparities, and correlations, providing valuable insights into global well-being.

#### Motivation & Target Audience

Our motivation is that global well-being is a critical issue that directly affects the quality of life of individuals and the sustainable development of societies. Today, economic fluctuations, social inequalities, and increasing mental health problems affect well-being levels in different ways around the world. Therefore, understanding the fundamental dynamics that determine well-being is not only beneficial but crucial for:

- **Policymakers:** To create evidence-based policies that improve people's quality of life.
- **Civil Society Organizations & NGOs:** To recognize and resolve disparities in well-being.
- **Researchers & Academics:** To have a better understanding of the factors affecting global well-being for further studies.
- **Individuals & General Public:** To raise awareness and encourage informed discussions on well-being.

#### Our Goals with Visualizations

- Ranking countries on indicators of happiness, quality of life, and mental health.
- Comparing correlations between happiness scores and specific quality of life metrics.
- Assessing the alignment between mental health metrics and overall happiness scores.
- Analyzing improvements or declines in well-being indicators across regions over time.
- Identifying patterns of countries that consistently perform well or poorly on various measures of well-being.
- Detecting countries that deviate significantly from typical relationships observed in the dataset (e.g., high mental health problems despite high happiness scores).
  
### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
